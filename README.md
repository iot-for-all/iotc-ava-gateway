# Azure IoT Central gateway module for Azure Video Analyzer
This sample demonstrates how to use Azure IoT Central to ingest AI inferencing from intelligent video cameras managed by Azure Video Analyer on the edge. The sample includes a custom Azure IoT Edge gateway module and deployment manifest to deploy all the necessary components to create intelligent camera devices.

The full documentation for IoT Central support for Azure IoT Edge devices can be found at [Connect Azure IoT Edge devices to an Azure IoT Central application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/concepts-iot-edge)

The full documentation for Azure Video Analyzer can be found at [What is Azure Video Analyzer?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/overview)

## Prerequisites
* An x86-64 or an ARM64 device running one of the [supported Linux operating systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/support#operating-systems)
* An Azure account that has an active subscription
* [Create and setup Azure IoT Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/quick-deploy-iot-central)
* [Create an Azure Video Analyzer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/create-video-analyzer-account?tabs=portal)
* [Install the Azure IoT Edge runtime on Debian-based Linux systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge)

The following Azure Video Analyzer documentation can be used as a guide: [Deploy Azure Video Analyzer to an IoT Edge device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/deploy-iot-edge-device), which guides through the process of using Azure IoT Hub directly. Since Azure IoT Central uses IoT Hub at the core this documentation will callout where to insert Azure IoT Central into the flow.

# Developer Notes
This repository is open to freely copy and uses as you see fit. It is intended to provide a reference for a developer to use as a base and which can lead to a specific solution.

Developer prerequisites:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v14 or later
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension installed
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) engine
* An [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) to host your versions of the modules

## Clone the repository and setup project
1. If you haven't already cloned the repository, use the following command to clone it to a suitable location on your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/live-video-analytics
    ```

1. Open the cloned **live-video-analytics** repository and cd into the *ref-apps/ava-edge-iot-central-gateway* folder with VS Code.

1. Run the install command. This command installs the required packages and runs the setup scripts.
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   As part of npm install a postInstall script is run to setup your development environment. This includes  
   * Creating a `./configs` directory to store your working files. This directory is configured to be ignored by Git so as to prevent you accidentally checking in any confidential secrets.
   * The `./configs` directory will include your working files:
     * `imageConfig.json` - defines the docker container image name
     * `state.json` - defines the properties read from the Edge device at runtime
     * `./mediaPipelines` - a folder containing the media pipeline files that will be included into your docker container image. If you have any fixed instance variables you would set them here in the `objectPipelineInstance.json` or the `motionPipelineInstance.json` file. An example would be the `inferencingUrl` variable used to call the Yolov3 module.
     * `./deploymentManifests` - a folder containing the Edge deployment manifest files for various cpu architectures and deployment configurations.

1. Edit the *./setup/imageConfig.json* file to update the image named based on your container registry name:
    ```
    {
        "arch": "[amd64|arm64v8]",
        "imageName": "[Server].azurecr.io/ava-edge-gateway",
        "versionTag": "latest"
    }
    ```

### Add Inference Endpoint for Custom Inference Service
In order to bring up your own custom inference service, you need to include the inference URL in *objectPipelineInstance.json*. Please follow below instructions to add value of inference URL.
1. In VS Code, open *./configs/mediaPipelines/objectPipelineInstance.json* file.
2. Edit the `inferencingUrl` parameter section to add value of `inference URL`(Line no.26). Below are the list of available inference endpoint values for AVA.

**OpenVINOâ„¢ Model Server**
- Vehicle Detection: http://OpenVINOModelServerEdgeAIExtensionModule:4000/vehicleDetection 
- Person Vehicle Bike Detection: http://OpenVINOModelServerEdgeAIExtensionModule:4000/personVehicleBikeDetection 
- Face Detection: http://OpenVINOModelServerEdgeAIExtensionModule:4000/vehicleDetection   

**YOLOv3**
- Object Detection: http://avaYolov3/score


### Edit the deployment.amd64.json file
1. In VS Code, open the the *configs/deploymentManifests/deployment.amd64.json* file. (Or, a specific deployment file that matches your scenario - e.g. OpenVINO, ARM64, etc.)
1. Edit the `registryCredentials` section to add your Azure Container Registry credentials.
1. See the [Create a Live Video Analytics application in Azure IoT Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/retail/tutorial-video-analytics-create-app) for more information about how to complete the configuration.

## Build the code
1. Use the VS Code terminal to run the docker login command. Use the same credentials that you provided in the deployment manifest for the modules.
    ```
    docker login [your server].azurecr.io
    ```

1. Use the VS Code terminal to run the commands to build the image and push it to your docker container registry. The build scripts deploy the image to your container registry. The output in the VS Code terminal window shows you if the build is successful.
    ```
    npm run dockerbuild
    npm run dockerpush
    ```

1. An alternative approach is to perform a multi-architecture docker container build. This requires [Docker Buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/). After reading the documentation and configuration a buildx instance you can use the following command to build an image for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
   ```
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -f ./docker/Dockerfile -t <YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>:latest .
   ```
   Note: add the `--progress=plain` flag to the buildx command to see verbose output that can help diagnose build issues.
